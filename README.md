# SNG (Scrambled Name Generator)

SNG is an application I wrote while trying to come up with creative names for an application, buisness, or idea. As many people have probably figured out by now, it is extremely hard to come up with an original and creative name. For this reason, I decided to create SNG.

SNG works by taking a user inputted list of names, separated by a comma and line space, and grabbing a series of characters from any given input on the list. The group of characters are then concatenated and searched for odd character placing such as two or three vowels placed back to back. You can achieve some interesting in unique names I've found by inputting the names of countries :D.

For the most part, the core of SNG is complete, however, I hope to add more features such as the length of the name you desire and better algorithms for creating more coherent names.
